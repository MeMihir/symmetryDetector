# Symmetry Detector
Finds the point and the angle of symmetry of a given image and gives a symmetry score

Basic algorithm is based on [here](http://www.tomgibara.com/computer-vision/symmetry-detection-algorithm) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53301086/how-to-identify-if-the-shapes-of-an-image-are-symmetric-or-asymmetric-using-open) stackoverflow post.

Will add docstrings and more detailed explaination of the code and usage soon!
